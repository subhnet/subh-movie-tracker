## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

Quickly spin up the application without installing Node.js or libraries locally.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd subh-movie-tracker

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# View the app
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

To run the scraper manually using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose exec app npm run fetch
```

#### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd subh-movie-tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template (optional)
# The script will work with defaults if .env doesn't exist
# cp .env.example .env
```

### First Run - Migrate Existing Data

If you have existing CSV files, migrate them to the new schema:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This will:
- Add new columns (watchedDate, notes, tags, etc.)
- Create backups of original files
- Preserve all existing data

### Usage

#### Fetch Latest Data
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run fetch
```

This will:
1. Scrape watched movies, watchlist, and shows
2. Back up existing CSV files
3. Update CSV files (preserving your notes/tags)
4. Generate statistics (docs/STATS.md)
5. Create HTML dashboard (index.html)

#### Generate Statistics Only
```bash
npm run stats
```

Creates/updates `docs/STATS.md` with:
- Total counts and averages
- Rating distributions
- Top-rated content
- Watching patterns
- Tag analysis

#### Generate HTML Report Only
```bash
npm run report
```

Creates/updates `index.html` - open in browser to view beautiful visualizations.

## 📊 CSV Schema

Each CSV file has the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Movie/show title | "Inception" |
| `rating` | Your rating (1-10 or N/A) | "9" |
| `watchedDate` | When you watched it (YYYY-MM-DD) | "2025-01-15" |
| `scrapedDate` | When data was scraped | "2025-10-05" |
| `notes` | Your personal notes | "Amazing plot twists!" |
| `tags` | Semicolon-separated tags | "favorite;mind-bending" |
| `rewatched` | Have you rewatched it? | "true" or "false" |

> **Note:** the CSV writer (`ObjectsToCsv`) always writes columns in
> alphabetical order on disk (`notes, rating, rewatched, scrapedDate, tags,
> title, watchedDate`), not the order listed above. This is harmless — every
> reader (`csvtojson`, `lib/csv-reader.ts`) parses by header name, not
> position — but don't assume column *position* when editing by hand or
> scripting against these files; always go by header name.

### Editing CSV Files

You can manually edit CSV files to:
- Add notes and reviews
- Add custom tags
- Set watch dates
- Mark items as rewatched

**Important**: The scraper preserves these fields when updating!

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file to customize behavior:

```bash
# Must App Username
MUST_USERNAME=subhransu

# Timeouts (milliseconds)
PAGE_TIMEOUT=180000
NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT=180000

# Auto-scroll settings
SCROLL_DISTANCE=100
SCROLL_DELAY=100

# Enable/Disable features
FETCH_WATCHED=true
FETCH_WANTS=true
FETCH_SHOWS=true
GENERATE_STATS=true
GENERATE_HTML_REPORT=true

# Backup settings
CREATE_BACKUP=true
BACKUP_DIR=backups
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Add Custom Tags

Edit your CSV files and add tags:
```csv
title,rating,watchedDate,scrapedDate,notes,tags,rewatched
Inception,9,2025-01-15,2025-10-05,Mind-blowing,favorite;sci-fi;mind-bending,false
```

### Track Watch Dates

Set the `watchedDate` column to see patterns in `docs/STATS.md`:
```csv
title,rating,watchedDate,...
Movie 1,8,2025-01-15,...
Movie 2,9,2025-01-20,...
```

### Add Personal Notes

Use the `notes` column for reviews:
```csv
title,rating,...,notes,...
Interstellar,10,...,Best movie ever! The soundtrack is incredible,...
```

## 🔄 Automation with GitHub Actions

Your repository can run this automatically! The workflow:
1. Runs on schedule (e.g., daily)
2. Fetches latest data
3. Commits changes back to repo
4. Git history = complete tracking history!

## 📈 Statistics Examples

The `docs/STATS.md` file includes:

- **Watched Movies Stats**
  - Total watched, rated, unrated
  - Average rating
  - Rating distribution with bars
  - Top 10 rated movies (8+)
  - Watching patterns (by month/year)

- **Want to Watch Stats**
  - Total on watchlist
  - Completion rate
  - Recently added items

- **TV Shows Stats**
  - Total shows tracked
  - Top-rated shows

- **Tag Analysis**
  - Most used tags across all content

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Regular Scraping**: Run daily to track changes
2. **Git Commits**: Commit CSV changes to track history
3. **Backup Folder**: Keep `backups/` in `.gitignore` (local only)
4. **Add Metadata**: Regularly add notes and tags to your CSVs
5. **Review Stats**: Check `docs/STATS.md` to discover patterns

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Scraping Fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify username in `.env` or code
- Increase timeout values in `.env`
- Check if Must app changed their HTML structure

### Migration Issues
- Backup files are created automatically
- Original files saved as `*_backup_pre_migration.csv`
- Re-run `npm run migrate` if needed

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## 🎬 Coming Soon

Potential future enhancements:
- CLI interface for searching and filtering
- External API integration (OMDb/TMDb) for metadata
- Watch time tracking and estimates
- Recommendation engine based on ratings
- Export to other formats (JSON, Markdown lists)
- Integration with Letterboxd/IMDb
