## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Custom Domain**: Add in Project Settings → Domains
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check Vercel Dashboard → Analytics
3. **Check Logs**: If something breaks, check Deployment Logs
4. **Update CSVs**: Push new CSV files to update your movie data

## ⚡ Quick Commands for Future Updates

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main

```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Vercel
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- The build works locally, so likely an environment variable issue

### AI Recommendations don't work
- Verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
- Check you have credits at https://openrouter.ai/credits

### No data showing
- Make sure CSV files are pushed to GitHub
- Check they're not in `.gitignore`
